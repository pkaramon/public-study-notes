# Educational Notes Repository üìöüéì

Welcome to my personal repository of educational notes.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

This repository is organized by topic, each containing both the original `.org`
files used for note-taking and their corresponding `.pdf` exports for easy
viewing. Here's a glimpse into the structure:

- `haskell-basics` - basic concepts of functional programming
- `cpp-notes` - the most fundamental concepts: types of memory, pointers,
  compilation process
- `finite-element-method-DEs` - solving a simple DE using the finite element-method
- `shell-scripting` - notes that contain some basics on creating shell scripts
- `git-basics` - overview of git commands and their usage
- `wstep-do-informatyki` - notes that I created when doing a course at AGH UST on basics of programming.
- `negative-integers-binary` - three different approaches on how to store
  negative numbers in binary
- `aes-basics` - basics of AES
- `diffie-hellman` - absolute basics of encryption
- `vim-tricks` - a collection of some of the most interesting tricks in vim

## Purpose and Use üéØ

The primary goal of this repository is educational. I created these notes to
help me understand complex concepts and serve as a future reference.  They are
shared in the hope that they might assist others on their own educational
journeys.
